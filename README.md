# Members only!
Project is part of **The Odin Project** curriculum, and can be found [here](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/ruby-on-rails-members-only#project-solution)

## Introduction
In this project, you’ll be working to implement authentication systems so users can only access areas of a site they are authorized to.

## Project: Members only!
In this project, you’ll be building an exclusive clubhouse where your members can write anonymous posts. Inside the clubhouse, members can see who the author of a post is but, outside, they can only see the story and wonder who wrote it.

If you want to add your own stylistic flourishes, consider it extra credit.
